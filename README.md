### todo

1. update names & descriptions of this and importer app
2. get directions in here and on importer app


### user experience

1. in ~functional-pear, they get HTML and CSS with broken images
2. they paste the HTML into index.html
3. they paste the CSS into style.css
4. on file changes to index.html and style.css, run a script that replaces broken web archive image links to local glitch app ones.

  - watch.json watch for changes to index.html and style.css
  - on changes, a script looks and replaces the broken links with web archive links
  - next script will wget each web archive link and replace the web archive link with the local url
