HELP US BRING BACK THE CREATIVE WEB!
====================================
Modern websites all look the same. And for some, the internet has literally just become Facebook. Compared to the early days of the web, where millions of people around the world were creating weird and wonderful websites that expressed themselves, the modern web can feel soulless.

But we know the good, fun internet is still out there. Help us bring back the creative web and show everyone how it's still a thing we all make, not just something we consume.

Show us how you got started building the web. Bring back your first web projects and share them with the world.

GET STARTED
-----------
- Find your first website on [archive.org](https://archive.org/)
- Paste the URL into the [Wayback importer app](http://wayback-importer.glitch.me/scraper).

The imported will extract the code for your site from the archive.

- Then hit "click here to make your site live again" and a new Glitch project will open in a new tab.
- Copy the HTML from the Wayback importer and paste it into your new Glitch project in the file `views/index.html` between the comments: "START website importer HTML code" and "END website importer HTML code".
- Do the same for your CSS. Copy the CSS from the Wayback importer and paste it into `public/style.css.`
Your app will now automatically look through your code for images, and save them in your project. Note: If your site has a ton of images then they might not all download automatically

-Once you see the green 'Live' button, hit "show" to see your website live on Glitch.

SHARE YOUR SITE
---------------
When you're happy with it, share it online for all to see and [submit it to us](https://airtable.com/shrwcr9CJ4Oytt0Z0) to be included in our [collection of first sites](https://glitch.com/websites).
