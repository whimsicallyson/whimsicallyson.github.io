My First (and/or really old) Website!
=================


### todo

1. update names & descriptions of this and importer app
2. get directions in here and on importer app (help from gareth/maurice to make instructions more understandable)

### user experience (instructions)

- Find your first website on archive.org
- paste the URL into functional-pear.glitch.me
- app will extract raw HTML and CSS from the archive
- hit "click here to make your site live again" button, remix of fish-coat will open in new tab
- in functional-pear, copy HTML to clipboard
- in remix app, paste HTML between "START website importer HTML code" and "END website importer HTML code" comments in index.html
- in functional-pear, copy CSS to clipboard
- in remix app, paste CSS in style.css file
- remix app will automatically scrape for images, save them to app storage, and replace their references in HTML and CSS files
- should probably mention storage size limits for a glitch app, so people understand if an image-heavy site doesn't get completely downloaded
- hit "show" to see your website, now as a glitch app!
